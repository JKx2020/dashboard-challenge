# dashboard-challenge

In this project I have built an interactive dashboard that explores the diversity of microbes that you find in human bellybuttons. The data set includes a small handful of microbial species (called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs in the study) that were found in more than 70% of people tested.

You will need to run this HTML in a live server. 

I use JavaScript and D3 to give the dashboard functionality and Plotly to graph the JSON data.
